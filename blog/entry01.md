### Why Medicine?  
At first, I didn’t really know what topic I wanted to do, as we weren’t allowed to pick topics that were exclusively just technology. However, I took [this quiz on SDN](https://www.studentdoctor.net/schools/selector) and found three different topics that were interesting for me:

1. Psychology  
2. Medicine  
3. Environmental Science  

Out of these three topics, I picked **medicine** because it’s something that impacts everyone and involves both science and problem-solving, two things I enjoy. Compared to the other topics, medicine also stood out because it’s very people-oriented and constantly evolving with new discoveries. I’ve always been interested in how the human body works and how diseases can be treated or even prevented.   

Additionally, as [this article](https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/doctors/why-study-medicine) mentioned, medicine requires critical thinking and lifelong learning skills which are important in any career in or outside of medicine, this appealed to me as I have flexibility in the future with what I would like to pursue. Another article that inspired me to pick this topic was [this one](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4147743/), which talked about how technology like AI is starting to inspire change for diagnostics and personalized treatment.

### EDP;
I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, which is to **define the problem**. The problem I want to solve is that many people don’t understand basic medical knowledge or how to take care of their health properly. Small things like poor diet, lack of exercise, or ignoring early symptoms can lead to bigger issues later on.  

Furthermore, I believe that it’s important to teach people how to prevent illness instead of only treating it once it happens. In the next stage, I plan to research different areas of medicine like public health, medical technology, and patient education by finding reliable sources and studies online.

### The Skills I've learnt;
Some skills that I have learned when working on this blog and researching topics are **How to Google** and **How to Take Notes**.

---

#### Conduct Proper Research;
A skill that I have learned is **How I could conduct research efficiently**. When searching things like *how medical technology improves diagnosis*, I realized that being specific helps a lot. Instead of typing a long question, I can use short phrases like *AI in medicine benefits* or *preventive healthcare examples*. Learning to search efficiently saves me a lot of time and helps me find academic sources faster. This is a big skill in my opinion as this is appliable to basically every subject and issue, in or outside my academics.

#### How to analyze Articles;
Another skill that I have learned is **How to analyze articles properly**. While researching, I found that I was forgetting where I read certain information. To fix this, I started **Breaking up the article by sections and taking notes on the side** and **Ctrl + F** to highlight key terms like *disease prevention* or *medical innovation*. This helped me quickly review important information and organize my ideas more clearly when writing. Breaking up an article by sections can help organize what information you need currently and what information you would need later on; learning the function of Control + F has saved me a lot of time, even writing this blog.
