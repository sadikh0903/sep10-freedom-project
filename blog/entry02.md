# **Entry 2 — Medicine Technology Research**

## **Content**
Medicine is the science of diagnosing, treating, and preventing illness. Modern medicine relies heavily on technology—both software and hardware—to help doctors work faster, safer, and more accurately. Through my research, I explored different medical tools used in hospitals today, including Electronic Health Records, imaging software, and diagnostic devices like digital stethoscopes and ultrasound scanners.

I also designed a future medical innovation called **MedScan+**, a mobile app that diagnoses people at home. Using the phone’s camera, microphone, and sensors, MedScan+ scans a user’s symptoms and compares them to millions of medical cases using AI. After generating a diagnosis, the app connects the user to a real doctor who can give prescriptions, treatment plans, and advice. The app can also deliver medicine to a person’s home. This technology would make healthcare more accessible, especially for people who cannot easily travel to a clinic.

## **EDP (Engineering Design Process)**

### **1. Identify the Problem**
Many people struggle to access medical care quickly, especially if they live far from hospitals or cannot travel easily.

### **2. Research the Problem**
I researched telehealth apps, medical scanning devices, and existing AI tools used in healthcare to understand what already exists and what is still missing.

### **3. Brainstorm & Develop Solutions**
Possible ideas included wearable scanners, AI chat tools, at-home medical pods, and mobile diagnosis apps.

### **4. Select the Best Idea**
I selected the mobile diagnosis app because nearly everyone owns a smartphone and it offers the most accessibility.

### **5. Create a Concept / Prototype**
I designed **MedScan+**, an app that scans symptoms, provides AI-powered diagnosis, connects users to doctors, and delivers prescriptions and medicine.

### **6. Test & Improve (Concept Stage)**
To prevent mistakes, doctors would confirm AI results. I identified improvements like better camera calibration, secure data storage, and emergency alerts.
